# BankManagerProject

Banks need to efficiently handle numerous transactions every day, such as processing withdrawals,
deposits, and loan applications. Many of these tasks involve prioritizing certain transactions over others.
For example:
- A high-value loan application may need immediate attention.
- A request from a customer with a large balance may need to be given high priority.
This project is a simulation of a bank transaction manager by implementing a priority queue using
a heap-based data structure.The program handles tasks based on their priority, ensuring the most
important transactions are addressed first
